"Ranged weaponry, as thought up by Steve."

At the moment, this is a port of QuiverBow to 1.8. I started doing this half for fun, and half because I wanted QuiverBow on 1.12 and was willing to do it my own damn self if necessary. I, uh... failed to notice that somebody is already working on a nearly-completed port to 1.12, and their version of it is more than likely far superior to this (which still doesn't even compile yet), but I figured I'd put this here anyway. (It's like backporting in reverse order! ...forward-porting! backwards! except it's also a worse version of the mod lol)

Anyway, I'm mostly just planning to complete this because I've already spent a decent chunk of time on it. I almost certainly won't bother with 1.12 and up since that's already covered, but I also make no promises about going further than 1.8, and I'm not even sure if I'll get *that* working. It's probably best you ignore this, hehe.
